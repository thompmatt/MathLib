# Math Library

The Math Library program is an assortment of mathematical functions. It contains basic functions such as rounding, floor and ceiling, finding the absolute value of a number, greatest common divisor, turn to String using a numerical base, and elevating a number to a certain power (exponent).

## Organization

The code is organized into three files: MathLib.h, MathLib.cpp and demo.cpp. This program also includes a Makefile. Inside the MathLib header file, all the functions are included but not defined. The MathLib.cpp file includes the header file and defines all the function bodies, going into detail on how they all work. Finally, demo.cpp runs the main method with print statements illustrating all the functions inside the Math Library.

## Compiling and running code

To compile the code:
- Open Terminal
- Navigate towards the location of the files / Makefile.
- Type "make" onto the terminal

To run the code:
- After compiling, type "./demo"
